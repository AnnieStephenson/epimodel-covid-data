# Epimodel data repository for COVID-19

This is the repository for sharing data in the Epidemics COVID-19 project.

While the data can be useful as is, the library and toolkit to use it is [epimodel](https://github.com/epidemics/epimodel), this repo is updated asynchronously to it.

All data files (mostly CSV and HDF5) are indexed by region Code (ISOalpha2 code for countries, ISO 3166-2 for country subdivisions, see the main repo for details).
